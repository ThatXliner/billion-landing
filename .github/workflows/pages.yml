# GitHub Actions workflow to build the static frontend and deploy the `build/` output to GitHub Pages.
# - Uses the official Upload/Deploy Pages actions
# - Builds using the project's `build:web` script which honors GH_PAGES_BASE
# - Triggered on pushes to `main` (adjust branch as needed) and manually via workflow_dispatch
